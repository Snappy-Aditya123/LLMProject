"Hey there! 👋 I am a  uni student and this is my Career Advice App project! Built with Streamlit, Ollama, LangChain, LLMs, and a Vector DB. It's still a work-in-progress, but here's what I have so far! 🚀

🎯 What does it do?

The app helps users get career advice using the power of LLMs. Right now, it has two main features:

CV Evaluator Agent 📋

You can upload your CV.

The agent reads it and rates it based on certain criteria.

Gives you tips to improve it!

Career Advice Chatbot 🤖

A chatbot that takes your evaluated CV.

Helps you with career advice based on your CV.

Uses a RAG system (retrieval-augmented generation) to pull in relevant info from a Vector DB.

🔮 Future Plans

I’ve got some big ideas for the next steps:

Integrate Reed.co.uk API 📊

To pull live job postings and give tailored advice.

Add News Search APIs 📰

So the bot can stay updated with the latest in the job market.

Improve RAG System 💾

Make the Vector DB even better with more data.
